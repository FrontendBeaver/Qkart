Project Overview
During the course of this project, we have implemented the following core features:

Authentication: Implemented the core logic for user authentication.

Shopping Cart: Added a shopping cart to the Products page, making it responsive. Made authenticated POST API calls to implement cart logic. Rendered the cart with different designs in both the Products page and Checkout page using conditional rendering.

Checkout Flow: Implemented the UI and logic to add and select new addresses during the checkout process.

Product Display: Utilized REST APIs to dynamically load and render product data served by the backend server. We also enhanced the user experience with responsive design elements for uniform viewing across different devices.

Search Feature: Displayed products and implemented a search feature on the Products page, using the useEffect() hook to fetch product data and implementing debouncing for improved user experience and reduced API calls.

Registration-Login Flow: Set up routing using the React Router library to redirect customers to appropriate pages. Added the UI and logic for the Login page and stored user information client-side using localStorage to avoid login on revisit.

User Registration: Implemented the registration feature, including backend API integration and input validation for the registration form to display informative error messages.
